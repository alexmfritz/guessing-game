# Guessing Game

Programming Project #3 for CS& 141 (Winter 2026) at Edmonds College. Focuses on `while` loops and random numbers.

## Overview

A command-line number guessing game written in Java. The program picks a random integer between 1 and 100 and prompts the user to guess until they find the correct number. After each incorrect guess, the program indicates whether the answer is higher or lower. The game supports multiple rounds and displays overall statistics (total games, total guesses, average guesses per game, and best game) when the user decides to stop playing.

## How to Run

```bash
javac GuessingGame.java
java GuessingGame
```
